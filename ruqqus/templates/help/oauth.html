# OAuth2

The OAuth2 authorization flow is used to enable users to authorize third-party applications to access their Ruqqus account without having to provide their login information to the application.

This page explains how to obtain API application keys, how to prompt a user for authorization, and how to obtain and use access tokens. 

## Step 1: Create your Application

In the [apps tab of Ruqqus settings](/settings/apps), fill in and submit the form to request new API keys. You will need:

* an application name
* a Redirect URI, or a comma-separated list of redirect URIs. May not use HTTP unless using localhost (use HTTPS instead).
* a brief description of what your application is intended to do
* client type - use Confidential for apps like bots that will store a `client_secret` in a server, or use Public for apps like third-party clients (SPA, Native App) that run directly on the user's machine.

All of these can be changed later, except for client type.

Ruqqus administrators will review and approve or deny your request for API keys. You'll know when your request has been approved when a client ID and secret appear in your application information.

With Confidential apps, DO NOT reveal your Client Secret. Anyone with your Client Secret will be able to pretend to be you. You are responsible for keeping your Client Secret a secret!

## Step 2: Prompt Your User for Authorization

Send your user to `https://ruqqus.com/oauth/authorize`, with the following URL parameters:

* `client_id` - Your application's Client ID
* `redirect_uri` - The redirect URI (or one of the URIs) specified in your application information. Must not use HTTP unless using localhost (use HTTPS instead). 
* `state` - This is your own anti-cross-site-forgery token. We don't do anything with this, except give it to the user to pass back to you later. You are responsible for generating and validating the state token.
* `scope` - A comma-separated list of permission scopes that you are requesting. Valid scopes are: `identity`, `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `vote`, and `guildmaster`.
* `permanent` - optional. Set to `true` if you are requesting indefinite access. Omit if not.

### Extra URL parameters for Public apps:

* `code_challenge_method` - Set to `S256`. This tells the server the `code_challenge` will be have been hashed with `sha256`.
* `code_challenge` - Generate a URL-safe random string and store it in a local variable as `code_verifier`. Then hash it with `sha256` - this is your `code_challenge`.

Generating a `code_challenge` in Python:

<pre>
	import os
	from base64 import urlsafe_b64encode
	from hashlib import sha256

	verifier_bytes = os.urandom(32)
	code_verifier = urlsafe_b64encode(verifier_bytes).decode("utf-8").rstrip("=")
	# Keep the `code_verifier`. You'll need it later.
	code_challenge = urlsafe_b64encode(sha256(verifier_bytes).digest()).decode("utf-8").rstrip("=")
</pre>

If done correctly, the user will see that your application wants to access their Ruqqus account, and be prompted to approve or deny the request.

## Step 3: Catch the redirect

The user clicks "Authorize". Ruqqus will redirect the user's browser to GET the designated redirect URI. The following URL parameters will be included, which your server should process:

* `code` - a **single-use** authorization code.
* `state` - The state token from earlier.

Validate the state token. How you do this is up to you.

## Step 4: Exchange code for access token

Make a POST request to `https://ruqqus.com/oauth/grant`. Include the following form parameters:

* `client_id` - Your application's Client ID
* `client_secret` - Confidential apps only. Your application's Client Secret
* `grant_type` - Set to the word "code"
* `code` - The `code` parameter that was given to you in the previous step.

### Extra form parameters for Public apps:

* `code_verifier` - The random code you used to generate your `code_challenge` in Step 2.

Python example:

<pre>
	import requests
	import pprint

	code=request.args.get("code")

	headers={"User-Agent": "Porpl Reader v1 by @captainmeta4"}
	url="https://ruqqus.com/oauth/grant"
	data={"client_id": my_client_id,
		  "client_secret": my_client_secret,  #Exclude if Public
		  "grant_type": "code",
		  "code": code,
		  # "code_verifier": code_verifier,  #Include if Public
		  }

	r=requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)

	pprint.pprint(r.json())
</pre>

If everything is good, we will respond with the following (example) JSON body:

<pre>
	{
	"access_token": 		#Access token
	"scopes": 				#Comma-separated list of scopes included in authorization
	"expires_at": 			#Unix epoch integer time at which access token expires
	"token_type": "Bearer"
	"refresh_token":		#This key is omitted in temporary authorizations
	}
</pre>

Store the access and refresh tokens. You should also store expiration timestamp and the scopes list, so that you pre-emptively avoid sending requests to Ruqqus that won't be accepted.

## Step 5: Using the Access Token

To use the access token, include the following header in subsequent API requests to Ruqqus: `Authorization: Bearer access_token_goes_here`

Python example, presuming that the application has obtained a valid `read` authorization:

<pre>
	import requests
	import pprint

	headers={"Authorization": "Bearer " + access_token,
			 "User-Agent": "Porpl Reader v1 by @captainmeta4"}
	url="https://ruqqus.com/api/v1/front/listing"

	r=requests.get(url, headers=headers)

	pprint.pprint(r.json())
</pre>

The expected result of this would be a large JSON representation of the submissions that make up the user's personal front page.

## Step 6: Maintain Access

Access tokens expire one hour after they are issued. To maintain ongoing access, you will need to use the refresh token to obtain a new access token.

Make a POST request to `https://ruqqus.com/oauth/grant` with the following form parameters:

* `client_id` - Your application's Client ID
* `client_secret` - Your application's Client Secret
* `grant_type` - set to the word "refresh"
* `refresh_token` - the refresh token which you obtained during Step 3

Python example:

<pre>
	import requests
	import pprint

	headers={"User-Agent": "Porpl Reader v1 by @captainmeta4"}
	url="https://ruqqus.com/oauth/grant"
	data={"client_id": my_client_id,
		  "client_secret": my_client_secret,
		  "grant_type": "refresh",
		  "refresh_token": my_users_refresh_token
		  }

	r=requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)

	pprint.pprint(r.json())
</pre>

A successful refresh will result in the following response:

<pre>
	{
	"access_token": 		#Access token
	"expires_at": 			#Unix epoch integer time at which access token expires
	}
</pre>

You should overwrite the previous access code and expiration timestamp with this new information. Continue to use the access token as in Step 5, until it expires.
